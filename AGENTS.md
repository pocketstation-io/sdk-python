# AGENTS.md — pocketstation-io/sdk-python

## Source of truth

Before editing, read:

1. `docs/architecture/PocketStation-v2.3.md`
2. `docs/REPO_CONTRACT.md`
3. Relevant ADRs in `docs/adr/`
4. The assigned GitHub issue

## Phase gate

This repo activates in **Phase 5**.

If the current project phase is earlier, do not implement code here unless the issue has `phase-exception-approved`.

## Rules

- One issue = one branch = one PR.
- Do not edit unrelated repos.
- Do not create `pocketstation-io/protocol` before Phase 2.
- Do not change v2.3 architecture unless explicitly assigned.
- Do not add dependencies without approval.
- Do not bypass CI.

## Engineering Standards

Before code changes, every agent must read:

- `docs/standards/STAFF_ENGINEERING_BAR.md`
- `docs/standards/STRUCTURE_NAMING_STYLE_THINKING.md`
- `docs/standards/PRODUCTION_ENGINEERING_BAR.md`
- `docs/REPO_CONTRACT.md`
- relevant ADRs
- current phase progress file
- `FAKE_SCAFFOLD_INVENTORY.md`

All code follows the structure, naming, documentation, test naming,
comment style, and thinking process defined there.

Every non-trivial implementation documents:
- invariant
- ownership model
- failure behavior
- test coverage
- phase scope
- what is intentionally not implemented

Every PR that introduces a fake/mock/scaffold adds a row to
FAKE_SCAFFOLD_INVENTORY.md. Every PR that replaces one burns
the row down.
